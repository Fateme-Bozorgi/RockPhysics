A collection of my MATLAB codes for modeling and analysis in rock physics developed as part of my MSc.


Code Overview:

(Xu-White Modeling)
This code implements the Xu-White model for estimating shear and compressional wave velocities, incorporating mathematical calculations and numerical modeling techniques while considering the effect of pressure.

(Gassmann Modeling)
The Gassmann code investigates the effects of fluid saturation in porous media. It applies Gassmann's equations to estimate wave velocities, highlighting the interaction between fluid properties and rock structure.

(Artificial Neural Network for Parameter Estimation)
This code employs artificial neural networks (ANN) to estimate key petrophysical parameters based on well-logging data.
